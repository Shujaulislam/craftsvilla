# Craftsvilla Landing Page

## Project Overview
This project is an implementation of an e-commerce landing page using modern web technologies. It was developed as part of a coding assignment to demonstrate proficiency in React, Next.js, and responsive web design.

## Technologies Used
- Next.js 13 (with App Router)
- React 18
- TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS
- Lucide React (for icons)

## Features
- Responsive design that adapts to various screen sizes
- Component-based architecture for maintainability
- Server-side rendering for improved performance and SEO
- Image optimization using Next.js Image component
- Placeholder content that can be easily replaced with actual e-commerce data

## Project Structure
- `app/`: Contains the main application code
  - `page.tsx`: The main landing page component
  - `layout.tsx`: The root layout component
- `public/`: Static assets
- `next.config.js`: Next.js configuration
- `tailwind.config.js`: Tailwind CSS configuration

## Challenges and Solutions
- Initially faced issues with SVG placeholders. Resolved by using JPEG format and updating Next.js configuration to allow external image sources.
- Ensured layout consistency across different sections using Tailwind CSS grid and flexbox utilities.

## Future Enhancements
- Integration with a backend API for dynamic product listings
- Implementation of a shopping cart functionality
- Addition of user authentication and profile management
